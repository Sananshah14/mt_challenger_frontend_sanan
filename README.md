# Frontend Setup Instructions

This document outlines the steps to set up and run the frontend of the project.

## Prerequisites

Before running the frontend, you must have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.

### 1. Install Node.js
To get started, you need to install Node.js, which includes npm (Node Package Manager).

- Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the version suitable for your system.
- Follow the installation instructions for your platform.

### 2. Install npm
- **npm** is automatically installed when you install Node.js. To verify that both Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open a terminal and run the following commands:

node -v
npm -v

Start the Frontend Server
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the frontend development server with this command:

npm run serve
This will start the serve: http://localhost:8080
